# KubePattern Project: Pattern As Code Registry

Welcome to the official public registry for the KubePattern project. This repository contains a collection of "Pattern As Code" definitions.

## What is "Pattern As Code"?

**Pattern As Code** is a declarative approach to defining Kubernetes patterns and best practices.

These patterns are written in YAML or JSON files, each describing the unique characteristics, resources, and relationships of a specific configuration or architectural model.

The [KubePattern](https://github.com/GabrieleGroppo/kubepattern) analysis tool uses these definitions to analyze your Kubernetes cluster. By comparing the cluster's state against the patterns defined in this registry, KubePattern can identify existing configurations and provide practical suggestions for applying patterns and best practices.
