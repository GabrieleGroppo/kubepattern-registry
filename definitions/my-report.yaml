    description: Identifies pods that should implement the sidecar pattern but are
      incorrectly separated into different pods. The sidecar pattern places helper
      containers alongside the main application container in the same pod to share
      lifecycle, network, and storage resources. Common use cases include logging,
      monitoring, configuration management, and service mesh proxies.
    message: Pod 'frontend' in namespace 'production' appears to be separated from
      its sidecar pod 'logging' in namespace 'production'.
